next-action-clojure
===================

A clojure application bringing [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) in Todoist.
Adds the support for **next actions** as weel as **Someday** inbox.

By default all projects are sequentials, meaning a project tasks are executed one after the other.

In addition, if the project name ends with *parallel-postfix*, the project will be parallel,
meaning all the task of this project can be executed (there is no order).

A project can also be considered as a list of task if its name ends with *list-postfix* as therefor should be ignored (used for the grocery list by example).

Finally, the project named *someday-label* will be ignored as well, since it contains the list of non-active projects.
